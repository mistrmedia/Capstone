By Yamar Ba

Suppose a new up and coming luxury boutique store selling designer clothes based in Los Angeles would like to expand its store locations to New York City and Toronto. The company would like to open locations in upper middle class to affluent communities. They also want to be positioned in high population neighborhoods. Which boroughs should the boutique consider? 

Demographic data on both Toronto and New York will be obtained from wikipedia.  Itâ€™s tables will be extracted and input into our programs dataframe. Specifically, we are looking for high income boroughs in Toronto and New York.

We are interested in the columns, Borough, Population Estimate and GRoss Domestic Product per capita from the New York table. Similarly, we want , Name, Population and Average Income Columns from our Toronto table. 

With the above data, we will be able to compare neighborhoods within the two cities to find the best fit for our needs. For instance, boroughs with above average incomes will be considered  as store locations and boroughs with below average incomes will not be considered for store locations. Boroughs with the highest income are the most desirable.

Based on the data Manhattan in New York City and North York in Toronto are the best boroughs to explore add new store locations.
